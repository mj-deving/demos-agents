**Spec:** `docs/colony-tooling-plan.md` P3

- [ ] 5.6c — Hybrid search: FTS5 + vec0 via Reciprocal Rank Fusion

**Spec:** `docs/colony-tooling-plan.md` P5 + `.ai/guides/colony-db-research.md` | **Blocked by:** 5.4 + embedding model decision

### Phase 5.7: Strategy Data Wiring (pre-Phase 6)

> Revealed by 2026-04-02 API audit. These wire existing capabilities into the V3 loop.
> Must complete before Phase 6 so the strategy refactor has real data to work with.

- [x] 5.7a — Wire `/api/signals` into V3 sense phase as 6th enrichment call (`2d1144d`)
- [x] 5.7b — `searchFeed()` available in API client; `combinedTopicSearch` not used in V3 loop (Phase 6 wires it)
- [x] 5.7c — 2-step tipping: POST /api/tip validates → transferDem() fallback (`2d1144d`)
- [x] 5.7d — `refreshAgentProfiles(db, since24h)` called after colony ingestion (`2d1144d`)
- [x] 5.7e — `recordInteraction()` in action-executor for ENGAGE, REPLY, TIP (`2d1144d`)

**Spec:** `docs/supercolony-skill-gap-analysis.md` "Strategy-Relevant Capabilities" | **Blocked by:** API completion merge

### Phase 6: Strategy Domain Refactor

- [x] 6a — Strategy rules consume enrichment data: publish_signal_aligned, publish_on_divergence, publish_prediction (`a9d613d`)
- [x] 6b — Strategy rules consume intelligence: engage_novel_agents from leaderboard, tip_reputable upgrade
- [x] 6c — Claim deduplication: FTS5-based `checkClaimDedup` + `checkSelfDedup` in `src/toolkit/colony/dedup.ts`
- [x] 6d — Auto-calibration: `computeCalibration()` replaces static readCalibrationOffset, cold-start guard
- [x] 6e — Post quality: inferCategory (content-driven), config schema with enrichment thresholds

**Spec:** `docs/phase6-strategy-refactor-plan.md` + `docs/research/supercolony-api-reference.md` | **Tests:** 2404 (+32)

### Phase 7: Strategy Phase 2 Rules

- [ ] 7a — Event verifier for non-numeric claims (`design-loop-v3.md` section 4a-ii)
- [ ] 7b — Strategy Phase 2 rules (from `design-loop-v3.md` section 6)
- [ ] 7c — Contamination check in faithfulness gate (unattested factual claims)
- [ ] 7d — Thread fan-out: 1 post = 1 claim, multi-claim → reply thread

**Spec:** `docs/archive/design-loop-v3.md` sections 4-6 | **Blocked by:** Phase 6

### Phase 8: Advanced

- [ ] 8a — Proof ingestion: verify other agents' DAHR/TLSN attestations on scan
- [ ] 8b — Contradiction detection in claim ledger
- [ ] 8c — Verified engagement: agree/tip only after verifying target's attestation
- [ ] 8d — Colony intelligence algorithm: smart scanning per `design-loop-v3.md` section 5

**Spec:** `docs/archive/design-loop-v3.md` sections 5+6b | **Blocked by:** Phase 7

### Phase 6 Deferred Items (valid work, not done this session)

> These are from the 72-criteria PRD. Common blocker: engine takes pure data, these need DB access.
> **Decision (2026-04-02):** Pre-compute in bridge, pass as optional fields on `DecisionContext`.
> Engine stays pure-function. See decision log entry.

- [x] 6-defer-a — Wire dedup guards into publish-executor (checkClaimDedup + checkSelfDedup)
- [x] 6-defer-b — Pre-compute interaction set in bridge, pass to engine for re-tip avoidance
- [x] 6-defer-c — Pre-compute agent profiles in bridge, pass for trust-scored mentions
- [ ] 6-defer-d — adapt_to_leaderboard meta-rule: design + implement priority adjustment
- [x] 6-defer-e — Score pre-calculation guard in publish-executor (calculateOfficialScore on draft)
- [x] 6-defer-f — Confidence optimization: always set, ≥40, scaled by evidence quality
- [ ] 6-defer-g — Calibration offset consumed by publish evidence threshold + tip generosity

### Phase 6 Discoveries (new capabilities from research, not in original roadmap)

> Scraped supercolony.ai/docs + queried SDK MCP. These are real platform features not yet supported.

- [ ] 6-disc-a — VOTE action type for price predictions (HIVE_BET memo, 5 DEM to pool) → **Phase 8**
- [ ] 6-disc-b — Binary market bets (HIVE_BINARY memo, Polymarket integration) → **Phase 8**
- [ ] 6-disc-c — Pluggable rule registry (rules as modules, not inline in engine.ts) → **Phase 7**
- [ ] 6-disc-d — Colony report consumption (/api/report briefings as planning context) → **Phase 7**
- [ ] 6-disc-e — Identity lookup enrichment (/api/identity for social handles) → **Phase 7**
- [ ] 6-disc-f — XMCore cross-chain reads for on-chain data verification → **Phase 8**
- [ ] 6-disc-g — SSE/webhook consumption for real-time reactive events (event-runner exists) → **Phase 8**
- [ ] 6-disc-h — Escrow to social identity: tip by Twitter/GitHub handle without wallet → **Future**
- [ ] 6-disc-i — ZK identity proofs for privacy-preserving attestation → **Future**

**Spec:** `docs/research/supercolony-api-reference.md` + `docs/research/demos-sdk-capabilities.md`

## Tech Debt

| Item | Target | Metric |
|------|--------|--------|
| Double-fetch in V3 loop (scan-feed + colony ingestion both call getHivePosts) | 2026-04-14 | 14 sessions with >0 actions |
| Cursor not functional (SDK has no sinceBlock param) | When SDK adds pagination | Track SDK releases |

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-03-30 | SENSE/ACT/CONFIRM replaces 8-phase V1 | 7 primitives → 3 phases; V1 had 5 ceremonial phases |
| 2026-03-30 | Signal-first publishing | Topic-first: 78% body_match=0. Signal-first: creative freedom + attestation grounding |
| 2026-03-30 | 1 post = 1 attestable claim | Focused, verifiable posts. Multi-claim → thread. |
| 2026-03-31 | Two executors (action + publish) | ENGAGE=1 call, PUBLISH=10 steps. Different complexity. |
| 2026-03-31 | SDK double-fetch acceptable (temporary) | Chain reads cheap. Consolidation target 2026-04-14. |
| 2026-04-01 | P0-P2 before Phase 6 | Strategy refactor needs data + tooling first |
| 2026-04-02 | Phase 5.7 before Phase 6 | API audit revealed broken tipping, missing signals/feed-search, unwired intelligence layer |
| 2026-04-02 | Signals are strategy-critical, not optional | `/api/signals` provides colony consensus — must be primary input to plan phase |
| 2026-04-02 | Tipping must use 2-step API validation | Direct `transferDem()` skips spam limits and indexer can't attribute tips |
| 2026-04-01 | No ORM for colony DB | Thin interface layer IS the abstraction |
| 2026-04-01 | Archive completed plan docs | design-loop-v3.md + phase5-plan.md → docs/archive/ (read-only reference) |
| 2026-04-02 | Phase 6 is reference implementation, not canonical strategy | Toolkit/loop/primitives are universal; sentinel rules are ONE demo |
| 2026-04-02 | All enrichment is optional (graceful degradation) | Rules skip when apiEnrichment is null — agent works without API |
| 2026-04-02 | Auto-calibration replaces static JSON | computeCalibration() in sense phase, cached in strategyResults |
| 2026-04-02 | Category selection is content-driven | inferCategory() replaces hardcoded "analysis" based on action reason |
| 2026-04-02 | Dedup module exists but not yet wired | checkClaimDedup/checkSelfDedup ready, needs publish-executor integration |
| 2026-04-02 | SDK capabilities doc is informational only | XMCore/StoragePrograms/ZK are Phase 8+ — no Phase 6 rules use them |
| 2026-04-02 | Engine stays pure-function: pre-compute in bridge, not DB handle | Engine's testability + agent-agnosticism is its strongest property. Bridge extracts intelligence data into DecisionContext fields. |
